# Analysis of text files
In this example we will use files provided with the ORIGAMI distribution. You can download [MS file](../../example-files/MS_p27-FL-K31.csv) and [heatmap file](../../example-files/heatmaps.zip) or you can find them in your ORIGAMI directory (example_data/text).

### Data loading
To load text files, please use any of the following:
* Use the file menu. File -> Open IM-MS Text file [CIU] or Open MS Text file
* Use the toolbar. Click on the **T** or **T+** button
* Use a keyboard shortcut:
    - **CTRL+T** - open heatmap text (.csv/.txt/.tab) file   
* Drag-and-drop the file in the main window
* Clipboard: - MS data only

### Document tree
Any file you open will result in generation of a **ORIGAMI document** that will contain all **data** that you will generate. It is structured just like a directory on your PC so it should be easy to get used to. When you right-click on any item, a custom menu will appear from which you can figure out what you would like to do. An example is shown below:

### Plotting and replotting
You can either double-click on an item in the **Document tree** or right-click and select the option "Show...". If you would like to clear a plot, right-click in the plot area and select "Clear plot".

### Panel: Textlist
All text-based heatmaps are automatically added to the Panel textlist where you can easily visualise and compare multiple files.

When you right-click on any item in the list, a menu will appear from which you can easily access various visualisation modes and customisation settings.

When you double-click on an item (or right-click and select "Edit file information") a new window will appear where you can change certain parameters, such as *charge state, color, colormap, etc*.
