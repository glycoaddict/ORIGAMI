You can download it here or it should be found in your ORIGAMI directory ( example_data/origami_ms ). Data loading Please have a look at MS and IM-MS data loading . Data extraction Please have a look at MS and IM-MS data extraction . ORIGAMI-MS method ORIGAMI-MS acquired files are simply CIU datasets that were acquired within a single file in which the collision voltage (or cone voltage) were ramped to increase the activation energy. There are four methods available which either increase or keep constant the number of scans-per-voltage as the energy increases. Linear: the collision voltage (CV) is ramped from Start Voltage (StartV) to End Voltage (EndV) with Step Voltage (StepV) as the increment. The number of scans-per-voltage stays the same and is controlled by Scans per Voltage (SPV) . Exponential: the CV is ramped from StartV to EndV with StepV as the increment. The SPVs increase as a function of an exponential function where the user specifies the Exponential % and Exponential Increment . These values determine the rate of the increase. Boltzmann: the CV is ramped from StartV to EndV with StepV as the increment. The SPVs increase as a function of an Boltzmann function where the user specifies the Boltzmann Offset . These values determine the rate of the increase. User-defined: values of SPV and CV are provided in a list by the user. The user-defined list looks something like this and is usually provided as a .csv file. SPV CV 3 5 6 10 9 12 12 20 Getting started The first thing to consider when analysing ORIGAMI-MS based files is the fact that they have a definitive start and end. These two points correspond to the initial and final collision voltage used during the acquisition. ORIGAMI-MS inserts two reporter regions into the acquisition window, and they tend to manifest itself as significant (or sometimes not) dips in the signal intensity. If you started the acquisition correctly, they should be easy to spot. See below for an example How to determine first scan Change the view to the RT (chromatogram) tab Zoom-in on the 'reporter' region in the retention time plot. The first value after the break is the start scan which will be used later on. In this case, the start scan is 7 which means the first CV in the experiment was applied on the 7th scan. How to determine ORIGAMI-MS parameters There are only two ways you can determine what parameters were used in the acquisition. You saved them in your labbook or in the header of the MassLynx file (recommended) You saved them to a .csv file using the Save parameters button in ORIGAMI-MS window during your acquisition If you have done neither of these things, you can try to figure out your parameters by going to the folder containing ORIGAMI-MS program and looking for the appropriate ORIGAMI_log_ DATE-TIME .log file which contains all commands executed by the program. How to combine the same CVs into one This is a crucial step that will combine multiple scans into one, corresponding to the typical CIU file. First, you must select ions of interest in the MS and subsequently extract the data. Once you've done that, follow these steps. ORIGAMI-MS panel Open the Processing panel ( SHIFT+2 keyboard shortcut or Menu - Process - Settings: ORIGAMI or click on the button) Fill-in all necessary parameters (depending on your acquisition method). In the example case, we've used: start scan - 7 , start voltage - 4 , final voltage - 200 , step voltage - 2.0 , scans-per-voltage - 3 . Go to the Panel: Peaklist and select some or all extracted ions In the toolbar, click on the Process( ) button and select - Combine collision voltages for selected/all ions (ORIGAMI) Ions with combined CVs should appear in the Document tree under Drift time (2D, combined voltages, EIC) .

If the check Bin mass spectra during extraction is selected, mass spectra will be automatically linearized based on the parameters set in the Processing panel: Mass spectrum . Extraction can take several seconds - minutes. 3.

You can download them here or it should be found in your ORIGAMI directory ( example_data/multi-field-dtims ). Manual CIU/SID/multi-field DTIMS Manual CIU/SID/DTIMS datasets consist of multiple files, each differing usually in the energy introduced to the system to either induce fragmentation or unfolding. In our case, we will be using CIU dataset where the collision energy was raised by several volts and we can observe some levels of unfolding. Data loading To load multiple Waters (.raw) files, please use any of the following: Use the file menu. File - Open multiple MassLynx (.raw) files [CIU] Use the toolbar. Click on the button Use a keyboard shortcut: - CTRL+SHIFT-R - open multiple Waters (.raw) files - IM-MS Drag-and-drop files in the Multiple files panel When you have added files to ORIGAMI-ANALYSE, you will be asked to provide document name and document path. If you would like to add more files to the same document, make sure you click on the document in the Document tree and then use any of the above options to load data. Manual CIU document ORIGAMI-ANALYSE utilises documents to maintain all raw and processed data. The MANUAL document is a little different, as it requires different type of processing as it is pooling results from multiple files into one. When data is loaded, ORIGAMI-ANALYSE will only load the mass spectra and all-ion mobility data. In addition, a average mass spectrum will be generated from all spectra loaded in. This spectrum will be available under the Mass Spectrum tag in the document tree whereas individual spectra will be shown under the Mass Spectra sub-tree. Data extraction Although we are dealing with multiple files simulatenously now, data extraction is no different. Please have a look at MS and IM-MS data extraction . In short, you press-and-hold CTRL on your keyboard and drag with your mouse (while holding left-button) in the mass spectrum. An ion is added to the Panel: Peaklist from where you can extract its information. Stitching-up several files together When data is being extracted for specific ion, ORIGAMI-ANALYSE will use the 'variable' column in the Panel: Multiple files to determine the order in which files should be added. This column can be numerical (e.g. collision voltage, drift voltage) or alphabetical (e.g. name). If no value is provided, its not going to be pretty... Getting started The example provided is a set of files from a linear drift-tube experiment where each file corresponds to different drift voltage. So the variable that will be set in the table is the drift voltage and in this case, is written in the file name. When you have added these files to ORIGAMI-ANALYSE, you will be asked to specify document name and document path. In this case, yu can simply call it moqtof (name of the instrument it was acquired on). There are 6 files with drift voltages of 20, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50 and 60 V. As you will notice, when these files were added, the value of variable is set to 0, as the DV parameter is not saved in the MassLynx (.raw) file. You can specify by double-clicking in the variable column and typing appropriate value. Clicking on any column header will automatically sort the table. Panel: Multiple-files Combining data from multiple files into one Once you have added ions to the peaklist, you can extract that information . Changing x/y-axis labels By default, the label associated with combined dataset is 'Collision Voltage (V)' as it is expect to be a CIU-like dataset. In our case it is drift voltage, so once the ions have been combined, we can change the label in the Document Tree. Average mass spectrum The average mass spectrum generated when the data is being added to the document might not have the desired parameters. You can 're-average' the mass spectra by selecting relevant items int the filelist and then clicking on the Process... button and selecting Average mass spectra (current document) . ORIGAMI-ANALYSE will use the parameters set in the Processing panel: Mass Spectrum . Plotting and replotting The easiest way to plot anything in ORIGAMI-ANALYSE is to do it from the Document Tree and either double-clicking on the desired item or right-clicking and selecting appropriate option. Alternatively, you can right-click on an item in the Panel: Multiple-files and select either Show mass spectrum or Show mobiligram .

Video tutorial Deconvolution in ORIGAMI-ANALYSE Any mass spectrum within a ORIGAMI document can be deconvoluted and therefore a document can contain tens of spectra, each with its own deconvolution results. The easiest way to get started is to find an item in the Document Tree, right-click on it and select Deconvolute using UniDec... which will open a new panel where you can adjust the parameters. Example data In this example we will use a file provided with the ORIGAMI distribution. You can download MS file or you can find it in your ORIGAMI directory ( example_data/text ). This file contains a mass spectrum of a intrinsically disordered protein, p27 that is approx. 22.5 kDa in size and has a very broad charge state distribution. Loading data Please have a look at Loading Text files . In short, you either drag-and-drop the text file in the main window of ORIGAMI-ANALYSE or go to File - Open MS Text file . Deconvolution Once you've loaded data, right-click on it in the Document Tree and select Deconvolute using UniDec... If you are using the example file, you can start with the settings shown below: Specify Pre-processing parameters. You can start with m/z start = 500 and m/z end = 2500 with m/z bin size = 0.1 using Linear interpolation method. Click on the Pre-process button. If you are using the Tabbed view , the results will be shown in the tab UniDec - MS Specify deconvolution parameters. If you are unsure about the sample you are analysing, specify a broad range of charge states and the molecular weight with large-ish Sampling frequency. This will help you narrow down the appropriate range for your sample. Once you are happy, click on the Run UniDec button. If you are using the Tabbed view , the results will be shown in UniDec - m/z vs Charge / MW vs Charge / MW tabs. Following successful deconvolution, you can find peaks and identify the found molecular weights. To do this, specify appropriate parameters in the Peak detection parameters section and then click on the Detect peaks button. If you are using the Tabbed view , the results will be shown in UniDec - Isolated MS / Barplot tabs. Visualisation of results Visualisation of individual species If you are lucky, deconvolution will result in a single species being detect. This is rather unlikely and therefore you will be presented with a range of detected MW. In order to select and visualise only one species at at time, you can select an item with a molecular weight in the Dropdown menu (see below) and click on the Isolate button. You can also label its charge states by clicking on the Label button. Note: It is likely that the automatic label optimiser is enabled and you can change that by clicking on the Customise plots... button and unchecking the Optimise label position option. Saving plots The easiest way to save any plot in ORIGAMI-ANALYSE is to plot it, customise it and then right-click in the plot area and select Save figure... . Note: It is likely that the figure will be automatically resized to a pre-defined image size. This can very occasionally cause problems, therefore you disable that option by unchecking the Resize on saving menu item. Saving data All deconvolution data is saved within the document and if you to the Document Tree and open-up the item (see below), you can right-click on any item and select the option Save results . If you click on the UniDec header, you can save all results at the same time.

Opening annotation panel Find the mass spectrum you would like to annotate in the Document Tree and right-click on it, then select Show annotations panel , a new window should show up: Adding an annotation Click on the Annotating: Off button so it switches to Annotating: On . Move your mouse to the mass spectrum window and hold CTRL on your keyboard while also dragging mouse over a peak (like during data extraction). When you release the mouse, a number of values will be added in the annotation panel (min/max band, position x, charge, intensity, etc) - all of which can be changed. When you are happy click on the Add annotation button. The annotation should appear in a list below. Repeat till you are fnished. Editing an annotation Select a annotation in the list below. Change any value. Click on the Add annotation button. Adding arrow to annotation Select a annotation in the list below. Uncheck the add arrow checkbox. Adjust values of position (x, label) and position (y, label) Click on the Add annotation button. Showing all annotations Click on the Show button and select appropriate option (e.g. Show m/z, intensity, charge). All annotations should be shown on the mass spectrum. Customising annotations You can adjust several parameters ( annotation color, arrow line thickness, label size, etc ) in the Customise annotations panel. You can open it by clicking on the Action button and selecting Customise other settings... . A new panel should open. Note: You will have to replot annotations as these settings do not automatically update. Duplicating annotations Sometimes you might have more than one mass spectrum a document that has a lot of the same peaks. You could manually re-add these, but there is a quicker way. Find the mass spectrum with annotations and right-click on it. Select Duplicate annotations... option. A new window will appear where you can select another document and mass spectrum to which annotations should be copied. Once you have selected, click Select and see if they have been copied. One thing to remember is that the intensity of the peaks in different peaks will vary so you have to fix the intensity of annotation label. To do this, open the annotation panel for newly copied annotations (Document Tree - Show annotations panel...) and click on the Action button. Once there, select Fix intensity option.
